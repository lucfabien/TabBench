## Introduction

Tabular data is prevalent in various industries, including finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. However, many existing benchmarks focus on image or text data, leaving a gap for tabular data analysis. TabBench aims to fill this gap by providing a standardized framework for benchmarking machine learning models on tabular datasets.

## Features

- **Standardized Datasets**: We provide a collection of widely-used tabular datasets.
- **Model Evaluation**: Easily evaluate the performance of different machine learning algorithms.
- **Metrics**: Use a variety of metrics to assess model performance, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Easy Integration**: Integrate with popular machine learning libraries like Scikit-learn and TensorFlow.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Access detailed documentation to guide you through the benchmarking process.

## Installation

To get started with TabBench, you need to clone the repository and install the required dependencies. Here’s how to do it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lucfabien/TabBench.git
cd TabBench
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For the latest releases, visit [TabBench Releases](https://github.com/lucfabien/TabBench/releases). Download the latest release file and execute it to set up the environment.

## Usage

After installation, you can start using TabBench. Here’s a simple example to benchmark a model:

```python
from tabbench import TabBench

# Load your dataset
data = TabBench.load_dataset('your_dataset.csv')

# Initialize a model
model = TabBench.Model('RandomForest')

# Train the model
model.train(data)

# Evaluate the model
results = model.evaluate()
print(results)
```

This code snippet demonstrates how easy it is to load a dataset, train a model, and evaluate its performance using TabBench.

## Benchmarking Process

The benchmarking process involves several steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: Clean and preprocess your tabular data.
2. **Model Selection**: Choose the machine learning algorithms you want to benchmark.
3. **Training**: Train the selected models on your dataset.
4. **Evaluation**: Use the provided metrics to evaluate model performance.
5. **Comparison**: Compare the results across different models to identify the best-performing one.
